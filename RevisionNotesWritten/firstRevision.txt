the array has the  index starts from the 
the for loop 
the start with first 0 the condidion the increment or the decrement 
the bracket for the  for  loop 
runnes until the condition fails
the array the largest  the 
the largest at the singlle flow is takes as for the first is the smallest
if greater then exchange with the previous value 
Math. max 
if else
the pointer 
the palindrome the foe loop inner for loop 
until the k the swap 
check 
the map for the count 
if one else increase the value 
the anagram 
the by two string if less then zero or not present false else true
the star printing the variable outside print and the re describe

The Stack is the array 
the the push the pop the swift 
the for loop starts form the last 2 condition until 0 ans the decrement if the 
the found the push into the Stack every time if stack lengt becones mans that not fount

the queue for the orange problem 
the while loop 
the if else 
the (){

}
the condition string is same for the 0 index and the 
the count increase the else the else for the  decrese the count 

the brakcet problem 
the array includes 
the array fill with the zero 
take the aput the vlaue for that index 

the the variable to stor ethe data 
can be change for the let let left array 
function for the parameneter 
the return for the function  
the removal for the dublicate is done for the inccrease the swap for the x
ans the increase the x++
move the zero 
swap for thr temp
the skip  for the x = x+2k

the bubble search 
the selection sort  insertion sort
merge sort
slow and fast pointer
