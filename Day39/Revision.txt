 the power of set object key value count 
 Anagram calcilation logic not present cancillation means drecreasing the value if the current 
 element is present if negative or not present not anagram 

 the Linkid list
let prev = new NodeList();
prev.next= head
Sentimen node 
next.next value 
slow fast 
for loop for the known travel move the variable
rename it and travel upto end fine the sloe make null or next is thenew head f must commect to head

the palindrome 
nid by slow fast  make reverse numm must point to mid temp variable upto cur prev must be at end 
reassignt last and the first 
traversal both when prev compare both the values and move if not then false 
complete travel means true at all
